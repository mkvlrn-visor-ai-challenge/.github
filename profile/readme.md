# mkvlrn-visor-ai-challenge

A simple SPA written in React, consisting of only one screen where you can chat a bit with a [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) powered bot, which, in turn, is a node.js/express application.

The live application can be accessed here: <https://mkvlrn-visor-ai-challenge.netlify.app>. The backend is deployed elsewhere (<https://mkvlrn-visor-ai-challenge.up.railway.app>) but it can only be accessed by the frontend client - it is behind a cors protection.

I've decided to create two separate repositories for the application because the separation of concerns just makes sense.

Backend repo: <https://github.com/mkvlrn-visor-ai-challenge/backend>
Frontend repo: <https://github.com/mkvlrn-visor-ai-challenge/frontend>

This challenge is different from what I've encountered in the past (most, if not all, have very specific requirements and instructions) and since it's really open-ended, I've chosen to pursue simplicity and directness. Also, I was only able to get started on it yesterday (Monday, 14/02), so there's that.

Because of this, the project lacks a couple of items that are very important to me personally - and this is not an excuse, just an explanation - and I feel I should be up front about it.

The project is missing testing. I know it's almost as important as the code itself, and it pains me to deliver something like that. I apologize for that.

Having said that, the code is simple enough and self-explanatory enough to forego in the interest of time.

Thank you for your consideration.
